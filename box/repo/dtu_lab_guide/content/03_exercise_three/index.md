## Download config

In this exercise we will show you how you can use Monaco to download an existing environment's configuration. This is particularely handy if you already have a lot of configuration that you want to use to start storing it in a repository, or if you want to have some sample configuration.

### Step 1 - Create an environments.yaml file
The first step, similar to what we did in exercise one, is to create an `environments.yaml` file.
In Gitea, navigate to `monaco/03_exercise_three` and open the `environments.yaml` file.

Fill in the file as follows, or copy the contents of the `environments.yaml` file stored in `monaco/01_exercise_one`. Make sure to replace `YOUR_ENV_URL` with your Dynatrace environment URL.

```yaml
perform:
  - name: "perform"
  - env-url: "YOUR_ENV_URL" 
  - env-token-name: "DT_API_TOKEN" 
```

Commit this file.

### Step 2 - Download configuration

Open your ssh client and connect to the virtual machine that was provided to you, either via the web shell or via a dedicated ssh client.

Go to the perform folder in your home directory:
```bash
cd ~/perform
```

Update the locally stored repo:
```bash
git pull
```
**Note:** You might need to execute this using `sudo`

Go to the exercise folder
```bash
cd monaco/03_exercise_three
```

Set your Dynatrace API token as an environment variable (disregard, if still set from previous exercise):

```bash
export DT_API_TOKEN=$(kubectl -n dynatrace get secret oneagent -o jsonpath='{.data.apiToken}' | base64 -d)
echo $DT_API_TOKEN
```

We will use the new experimental CLI that will allow us to download the Monaco config. We can activate it by supplying the environment variable `NEW_CLI=true` to the command. Execute the following command to get an overview of the options:
```bash
NEW_CLI=true monaco
```

Will result in:

```bash
You are using the new CLI structure which is currently in Beta.

We plan to make this CLI GA in version 2.0.0

DESCRIPTION:
   Tool used to deploy dynatrace configurations via the cli
   
   Examples:

   --version   print the version (default: false)
```

We now have access to a new option to download the configuration, let's try it out!

```bash
NEW_CLI=true monaco download -e=environments.yaml
```

Monaco will now download the config:
```bash

We can now push this content back to our git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "download new config snapshot"
git push
```

Go to Gitea and inspect the newly uploaded Dynatrace config. GitOps is yet another step closer!
